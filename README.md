Hands On Threat Modeling Workshop Materials
Robert Hurlbut

Ideally, a Windows 10 laptop is used. You could use a Mac or Linxu laptop, but for Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool you will need a Windows VM installed / available.

You will need installed / downloaded to your Windows 10 instance:

1. Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool v7.1.x - download here https://aka.ms/threatmodelingtool
    a. Latest version is 7.1.61015.1 - released 10/16/2019, but above URL will always get you latest version.
    b. Alternate: Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool 2016 will also work.
    
2. Download sample threat models from the GitHub account: https://github.com/rhurlbut/CodeMash2020
